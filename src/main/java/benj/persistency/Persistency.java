 * This module is responsible for saving and loading the current game state to and from
 * persistent storage (e.g. files on disk, databases, etc). This allows the player to leave the game
 * and come back to it later at exactly the same state they left it in. 
 * e.g. the same window, inputs for fields etc. Not to be confused with Recorder which is
 * responsible for saving and loading the actual game data (e.g. player progress, game objects, etc).
